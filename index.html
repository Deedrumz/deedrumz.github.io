                I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br />
                knowledge in software development. However, within a few <br />
                weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and <br />
                also master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
                <br />
                <br />
                So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
                <br />
                push in my career as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
                <br />
                in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
                <br />
                different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
                <br />
                fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were <br />
                presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
                <br />
                <br />
                Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.

                    You'll be exposed to querying the database to perform the CRUD
                    functions - <br />
                    Create, Read, Update and Delete resources.

                We love to hear questions from our prospective students, almost as much as we love <br>
                providing answers to them. Here are a few questions along with our responses:

                <h6>Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h6>
                <p>
                    There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there <br>
                    is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and <br>
                    experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions. <br>
                    <br>
                    The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business <br>
                    globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h6>What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of <br>
                    The Course?
                </h6>
                <p>
                    By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web- <br>
                    based programming language â€“ JavaScript. Youâ€™ll have built several full-stack <br>
                    applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a <br>
                    development environment. <br>
                    <br>
                    Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll <br>
                    have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development â€“ <br>
                    managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, <br>
                    and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h6>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h6>
                <p>
                    Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a <br>
                    storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through installing the <br>
                    necessary free software. <br>
                    <br>
                    At least, youâ€™ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous <br>
                    programming language experience is required. <br>

                <br>

                <h6>What Does Success In This Program Look Like? </h6>
                <p>To get the most out of this course, you have to be willing to fully immerse yourself <br>
                    (get it?) in the classroom environment. This means actively engaging with your <br>
                    instructors, classmates, and career coach, as well as taking every opportunity to <br>
                    apply your new skills toward real-life projects. <br>
                    <br>
                    Weâ€™ll help guide you through the entire process, but in order to succeed youâ€™ll need <br>
                    to completely commit to your work and continuously push yourself.
